# rust-corosync
Rust bindings for corosync

Rust bindings for cfg, cmap, cpg, quorum, votequorum are part of this
source tree, but are included here mainly to keep all of the
corosync APIs in one place and to ensure that everything is kept
up-to-date and properly tested in our CI system.

The correct place to get the Rust crates for corosync
is still crates.io as it would be for other crates. These will be
updated when we issue a new release of corosync.

https://crates.io/crates/rust-corosync

Of course, if you want to try any new features in the APIs that
may have not yet been released then you can try these sources, but
please keep in touch with us via email or IRC if you do so.
